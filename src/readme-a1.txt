I verified that my Assignment 1 submission builds and runs correctly on the ECS-General AVD remote lab machine.

Steps I followed:
	1	Exported a clean build of my Codename One project (A1Prj.jar) from Eclipse.
	2	Created a zip file containing both the src folder and the dist/A1Prj.jar file.
	3	Transferred the zip to the ECS-General AVD remote machine.
	4	Logged into the ECS-General AVD environment as instructed on Canvas.
	5	Unzipped the submission file into a working directory on the lab machine.
	6	Navigated into the project folder (A1Prj).
	7	Ran the program from the command prompt using the assignment command:    
  "java -cp dist\A1Prj.jar;JavaSE.jar com.codename1.impl.javase.Simulator com.mycompany.a1.Starter"  
	8	The Codename One simulator launched successfully and displayed my Game form with the text input field.

Testing results:

All commands behaved exactly as specified:
	◦	a accelerates the ant.
	◦	b brakes the ant.
	◦	l and r turn the ant.
	◦	c updates the food consumption rate with the random adjustment rule.
	◦	1, 2, 3, … register sequential flag collisions; non-sequential input prints an error message.
	◦	f simulates food station collision (ant food increases, station capacity set to zero, new station created).
	◦	g simulates spider collision (health decreases, color fades, speed clamped).
	◦	t advances the game clock (time increments, food decreases, ant/spiders move).
	◦	d displays current status values.
	◦	m displays the map of all objects.
	◦	x followed by y exits; x followed by n cancels exit.
	•	Console output showed all updates and matched the assignment specification.
	•	The game ends properly when the last flag is reached (“Game over, you win!”) or all lives are lost (“Game over, you failed!”).

Submission contents (in the zip file):
	•	src folder with all Java source files.
	•	dist\A1Prj.jar built and tested on the ECS-General AVD machine.
	•	UML Diagram

Submission Contents (Outside ZIP File):
	•	readme-a1.txt

Conclusion: I confirmed that my submission (src + jar in one zip) runs without issues on the ECS-General AVD lab machine from the Windows command prompt, as required.
